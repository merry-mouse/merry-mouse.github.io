        <p>
          Program reads two txt files. One of them is a DNA database with the
          count of Short Tandem Repeats (STRs) in DNA of each person. Another
          one is a sequence of DNA from the crime scene. The program takes a
          sequence of DNA and a CSV file containing STR counts for a list of
          individuals and then output to whom the DNA (most likely) belongs.
