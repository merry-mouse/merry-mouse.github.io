        <p>
          I am a former MBA student, living in Stockholm, Sweden, who is
          passionate about programming and problem solving. My interest for
          programming grew from the subject of my master thesis which was
          "Blockchain technology for credit risk management". I have most
          experience in Python and most of my projects were written in Python
          language but I also have basic knowledge of SQL, JavaScript, HTML and
          CSS, C, MatLab.
